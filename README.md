# XP Values Implemented
1.	Simplicity
After the initial prosed design, we did a thorough review of it and removed all unnecessary components. We kept only features that were necessary and removed all assumed features. We also simplified the UI design and made it intuitive to the user.

2.	Communication
Since we were located at different addresses, we ran the weekly scrum meetings on google meet. We established a WhatsApp group to facilitate communication between the group. We also had meetups on campus at critical stages of the project to better understand the dependencies of fellow team members.

3.	Feedback
We regularly reviewed each otherâ€™s and provided comments for the author of the code. Only after approval by a fellow team member, and incorporation of those comments, the code was merged to the main branch.
